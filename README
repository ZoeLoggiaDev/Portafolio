## Description
--- 

The JavaScript calculator is a quite common project among beginners and students, and each have their
reasons to do it. My goal for this project was to fully understand how the JavaScript code could be
integrated to the visual part of the project to make it interactive for the users. 
In addition, I counted with the help of fellow more advanced colleagues and the Calculator ended up being
a great mediatory for us to get familiarized with Git and Github and making our first commits. 

<!--Usage-->
